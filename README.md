## What is NoSQL?
NoSQL, short for "Not Only SQL," refers to a variety of database systems that are designed to handle large volumes of data that don't necessarily fit into traditional relational databases. Unlike SQL databases NoSQL databases are more flexible and scalable, often making them ideal for big data applications and real-time web apps.

## Comparing SQL to NoSQL
### SQL Databases

**Structured Data**\
SQL databases use structured query language (SQL) to define and manipulate data. The data is stored in tables with predefined schemas.\
**ACID Compliance**\
Transactions in SQL databases are ACID-compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), ensuring reliable and consistent transactions.\
**Vertical Scalability** Typically, SQL databases scale vertically by adding more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing server.

### NoSQL Databases
**Flexible Schema**\
NoSQL databases store data without a predefined schema, allowing for more flexibility. They can handle structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
Eventual Consistency: Many NoSQL databases are designed for eventual consistency, where the system will be consistent over time, not necessarily immediately.
Horizontal Scalability: NoSQL databases scale horizontally by adding more servers to the database.

### What Languages Can Be Used with NoSQL?
NoSQL databases can be accessed using various languages and interfaces, depending on the specific database. Here are some common ones:

- JavaScript (Node.js)
- Python
- Java
- C#
- Go
- Ruby
- PHP



Each NoSQL database might have its own specific language or query interface, like MongoDB uses BSON (Binary JSON) and its own query language.

## Example NoSQL Schema Design

In a NoSQL database, such as MongoDB, instead of defining tables and relationships, you store data in documents. Hereâ€™s a simple example for a blog application:

SQL Schema:
```
Table: Users
id, username, email
Table: Posts
id, user_id, title, content, created_at
```

NoSQL Schema (MongoDB):

```
{
  "user_id": "12345",
  "username": "johndoe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "posts": [
    {
      "post_id": "54321",
      "title": "My First Blog Post",
      "content": "This is my first ever blog post!",
      "created_at": "2024-05-21T12:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Concept and Benefits
### Scalability
**Horizontal Scaling**\
Adding more servers to distribute the load.

**Sharding**\
Distributing data across multiple machines to ensure that no single machine is overwhelmed.

### Benefits:
**High Availability**\
Redundant copies of data across multiple servers ensure that the database remains available even if one server fails.

**Performance**\
Can handle large volumes of read and write operations with low latency.\

**Flexibility**\
Easily adapt to changing data requirements without needing to restructure
the entire database.

### Negatives

**Eventual Consistency**\
Unlike SQL databases, many NoSQL databases don't guarantee immediate consistency, which can be problematic for applications requiring real-time accuracy.

**Complexity**\
Managing a distributed system can be complex and may require specialized knowledge.

**Limited Capabilities for Complex Queries**\
While NoSQL databases excel at simple queries and fast access, they might not be as efficient for complex queries that involve multiple data relationships.

### Types of NoSQL Databases
**Document Stores**\
Examples: MongoDB, CouchDB\
Description: Store data as documents, typically in JSON or BSON format.

**Key-Value Stores**\
Examples: Redis, DynamoDB, Riak\
Description: Store data as a collection of key-value pairs. Ideal for caching and session management.

**Column-Family Stores**\
Examples: Cassandra, HBase\
Description: Store data in columns rather than rows. Suitable for handling large amounts of data across many servers.

**Graph Databases**\
Examples: Neo4j, ArangoDB\
Description: Store data in nodes, edges, and properties. Perfect for data with complex relationships like social networks.

**Time Series Databases**\
Examples: InfluxDB, TimescaleDB\
Description: Optimised for time-stamped or time-series data, such as log data or IoT sensor data.

**Object-Oriented Databases**\
Examples: db4o, ObjectDB\
Description: Store data in objects, similar to object-oriented programming languages.

# Case Studies
### Twitter
Database Used: Cassandra\
Use Case: Twitter uses Cassandra to store billions of tweets. Cassandra's ability to handle large volumes of data across multiple servers ensures high availability and fast read/write operations.

### Netflix
Database Used: DynamoDB, Cassandra\
Use Case: Netflix relies on NoSQL databases for its scalable architecture to handle streaming data, user data, and personalized recommendations. The distributed nature of NoSQL databases helps Netflix manage massive amounts of data efficiently.

### LinkedIn
Database Used: Voldemort (a key-value store)\
Use Case: LinkedIn uses Voldemort for various services that require high availability and speed, such as managing member profile data and activity feeds.

### eBay
Database Used: HBase\
Use Case: eBay utilises HBase to store and process vast amounts of transactional data. HBase's ability to scale horizontally allows eBay to handle heavy traffic and large datasets.

### Conclusion
NoSQL databases offer a powerful alternative to traditional SQL databases, providing flexibility, scalability, and high performance for handling large volumes of diverse data. While they come with their own set of challenges, their benefits make them suitable for many modern applications, from social media to e-commerce. Understanding the different types of NoSQL databases and their use cases can help you choose the right solution for your specific needs.
